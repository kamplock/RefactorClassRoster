# RefactorClassRoster
This project for CMP 311 - Back End Design is the Refactored Class Roster. Originally, there was only 1 class to put all the code into. 
This has been refactored to use the MVC design method. Users can pick an instructor and add as many students as they like. 
They can then sort the students by how they were typed in, by last name, or by class rank. Finally, users can press '5' to quit.
